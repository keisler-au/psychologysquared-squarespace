The assumption was that AI is the problem. I’d like to propose another alternative which suggests avoiding AI’s pitfalls.

AHPRA now have a page on “Meeting your professional obligations when using Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.” Last week we announced that AHPRA had listed a new digital competency fact sheet mentioning AI: <a href="https://bit.ly/hugewinai" target="_new">https://bit.ly/hugewinai</a>. Now, in addition, AHPRA is explicitly describing our obligations. See their info page here: <a href="https://bit.ly/AIAHPRA" target="_new">https://bit.ly/AIAHPRA</a></p><p class="">AHPRA notes that AI is "becoming rapidly integrated into many areas of healthcare". This necessitates further educational activities for AHPRA regulated clinicians into how they can or should use "AI in their practice".</p><h3>AHPRA drew attention to the <strong>benefit of AI tools to:</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">"Improve client care and patient satisfaction by reducing admin burdens and health practitioner burnout". This means that AHPRA has noticed that AI tools can save clinicians time.

  <p class=""><strong>These are based on professional competencies which ‘are in effect from 1 December 2025.’</strong></p><p class="">There are specific competencies alluded to as relevant to digital literacy:</p><p class=""><strong>Competency 6.4:</strong> “<em>Effectively uses the most appropriate form/s of communication for the client and context; and is aware of the limitations of each mode of communication, including both face to face and digital health practice</em>.”</p><p class=""><strong>Also note Competency 2.1 – 2.10:</strong> “<em>Practises ethically and professionally. Competency 2 addresses the legal and ethical use of digital health to practice safely and within the boundaries of professional competence</em>.”</p><p class="">The fact sheet states that digital health as including ‘any use of AI in psychological practice.’  Although not specifically referring to AI, there is the suggestion of a basic level of digital capability: “We expect that all psychologists will have a foundational level of understanding so they can meet the minimum threshold professional competency.” Although there does appear to be some flexibility,</p><p class="">“There is no set way to meet this competency. Practitioners should use their professional judgement when applying the professional competencies for psychologists to ensure they can sufficiently demonstrate them in their role and workplace as relevant to their scope of practice.”</p><p class="">The fact sheet also suggests that if you identify digital competence [in AI] as a learning need, it includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">“<em>investigating the opportunities and challenges for using artificial intelligence (AI) in psychology practice”</em></p></li><li><p class="">“<em>seeking advice from a digital health champion in identified areas of your practice</em>”</p></li></ul><p class="">The fact that the Psychology Board have identified the importance of AI and included it in the competencies is a <strong>huge win for AI in the psychological space</strong>.
