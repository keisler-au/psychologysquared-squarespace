However, it can also be challenging as you navigate new roles, workplace expectations, and professional milestones like <a href="https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/npe">preparing for the National Psychology Examination</a>. Advocating for yourself at work is an essential skill that ensures your needs are met while you continue to develop professionally and personally. Without it, you may find yourself overworked, underappreciated, and potentially compromising the quality of care you provide to your clients.</p><p class="">Here’s how to effectively advocate for yourself as an early-career psychologist and why it’s crucial for long-term success.</p><p class=""><strong>Understanding Reasonable Workloads</strong></p><p class="">As a <a href="https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/provpsych" target="_blank">provisional psychologist</a> or early-career psychologist, you may face high expectations, including managing a heavy clinical load.&nbsp;You’ll also need a thorough understanding about workplace policies, supervision requirements, and the expectations around completing your national psychology exam questions. The general recommendation in most workplaces is to start with 3-4 clinical hours per day and gradually build up to around 5 client facing hours in a standard workday. This structure ensures you have sufficient time for critical activities such as planning, client-related administration, and personal reflection, all of which are essential for delivering high-quality care. Unfortunately, many workplaces may push for higher productivity, which can lead to burnout. By advocating for reasonable workloads from the start, you can protect your mental health while also maintaining a high standard of practice.</p><p class=""><strong>Initiating Conversations with Your Employer</strong></p><p class="">One of the most challenging aspects of self-advocacy is knowing how to bring up these issues with your employer or supervisor if there’s a problem. It’s important to approach the conversation in a constructive and collaborative way. Start by highlighting your commitment to providing the best care for your clients and explain how an unmanageable workload may hinder that. Discuss the benefits of having adequate time for case planning, professional development, and reflection, which are not just beneficial to you, but also to the clients and the organisation.</p><p class="">Make sure to reference the guidelines and standards that support your stance. For example, the Australian Association of Psychologists Inc. (AAPI) provides valuable resources on managing workloads and advocating for fair conditions. By presenting your case professionally, you're more likely to gain support from your employer.If you are a member you can also review the<a href="https://www.aapi.org.au/Web/Shared_Content/Smart-Suite/Smart-Library/Public/Smart-Library-View-v1-0.aspx?resource=43"> AAPI’s resource library</a> for additional information on advocating for better conditions.</p><p class=""><strong>Advocate for Supervision and Mentorship</strong></p><p class="">Supervision is a cornerstone of early-career development in psychology. If you feel your current supervision isn’t meeting your needs - whether in terms of frequency, quality, or relevance - advocate for change.</p><p class="">You might say, “I’d like to focus more on practice scenarios related to the national psychology exam questions during our supervision sessions. Could we allocate some time for this?”</p><p class="">Most supervisors will appreciate your initiative and be willing to adjust their approach to better support your growth.</p><p class=""><strong>Knowing Your Value</strong></p><p class="">As a new psychologist, it’s easy to feel that you need to accept everything that comes your way. However, it’s important to remember that you have valuable skills and insights, even at the early stages of your career. Being able to request reasonable allowances, such as time for reflection, clinical planning, and supervision, is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of professionalism. Your ability to reflect on your practice and improve as a psychologist directly contributes to better client outcomes.</p><p class=""><strong>Celebrate Your Achievements</strong></p><p class="">Advocating for yourself also means acknowledging your successes, no matter how small they may seem. Passing a challenging set of <a href="https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/products-for-provisional-psychologists/p/npe-practise-qn-scenario-feb25" target="_blank">national psychology exam questions</a>, receiving positive feedback from a client, or presenting in a team meeting are all accomplishments worth celebrating.</p><p class="">Recognising your progress reinforces your confidence and demonstrates your value to your workplace. Don’t hesitate to share these milestones with your supervisor or colleagues, it’s a great way to highlight your contributions and growth.</p><p class=""><strong>Practical Tips for Self-Advocacy</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Be clear about your needs</strong>: Understand what you require to perform your job effectively. This might include capped clinical hours, regular supervision, or more time for professional development.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Use evidence to back your request</strong>: Refer to professional guidelines and recommendations to justify your needs. Being knowledgeable about industry standards shows that your requests are reasonable and aligned with best practices.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Seek support</strong>: If advocating for yourself feels daunting, consider discussing it with colleagues or a mentor. They may offer advice on how to approach the conversation or even support you in advocating for better workplace conditions.</p></li></ol><p class=""><strong>Self-Advocacy Matters</strong></p><p class="">As an early-career psychologist, your journey is filled with opportunities to shape your professional identity and achieve your goals. Advocating for yourself is a key part of this process - it empowers you to take charge of your career, ensure your needs are met, and set the stage for long-term success.</p><p class="">Advocating for yourself isn’t just about asking for less work or for what you need, it’s about ensuring you have the time and space to provide the best possible care for your clients while also supporting your own professional growth. By speaking up and taking proactive steps, you’re building a foundation for a fulfilling and impactful career in psychology.</p><p class="">At Psychology Squared, we pride ourselves on supporting provisional psychologists to get through their internship with a range of resources and supervision support.

One of the most powerful tools you have during this time is reflection. This means taking the time to reflect on your experiences which can help, not just what you’re doing in therapy but also what you bring to the therapeutic relationship. This can significantly enhance your learning and growth and even help with your preparation for the National Psychology Exam. However we don’t often enough take the time to reflect. </p>

  <h2>Why Reflection Matters</h2><p class="">Reflection is more than a required part of your logbook during internships, it’s a way to actively engage with your development. By reflecting on your own values and assumptions, you gain insights into how these influence your interactions with clients. It also helps you evaluate whether the interventions you’re using are effective. You might notice, for example, that a particular therapeutic technique resonates with some clients but not others. By reflecting on these patterns, you can adjust your approach to better meet your clients’ needs.</p><h2>Using Reflection to Track Client Progress</h2><p class="">Reflecting on client progress is key to improving your practice. Are your clients moving forward? If not, what could be adjusted in the treatment plan? Use your supervision sessions to discuss these reflections. Supervisors can provide invaluable feedback on whether your assessments are aligned with best practices or if there’s another way to interpret a client’s progress. This kind of reflective practice is especially helpful when documenting your client-related activities in your logbook. When you jot down your reflections, don’t just think about what happened in the session; consider why it happened and how it informs your future work.</p><h2>Incorporating Reflection into Your Logbook</h2><p class="">As part of the 5+1 internship program, you’re required to record reflections on your experiences in the logbook​. The <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists/p/ultimate-internship-logbook-template">Psychology Squared Logbook</a> has ideas for reflection and spaces dedicated for you to compete reflections. </p><p class="">Reflections aren’t just a formality or a box to tick, it's an opportunity to regularly evaluate your growth. When you complete your logbook entries, take the time to think critically about your clinical decisions. What challenges did you face this week? How did you manage them? Are there gaps in your knowledge or skills that you need to address? These reflective questions will help you monitor your development and ensure that you're meeting the core competencies required for registration. </p><h2>Practical Tips for Reflective Practice</h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Set aside time for reflection</strong>: Carve out specific time after client sessions or at the end of the week to reflect on your practice. This dedicated space will make reflection a habit.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Ask open-ended questions</strong>: When reflecting, ask yourself questions like, “What worked well with this client?” or “What could I have done differently?”</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Use supervision effectively</strong>: Bring your reflections to your supervision sessions. Discussing your thoughts with your supervisor can provide new perspectives and deepen your understanding of your own practice.</p></li></ol><h2>Supporting Your Learning through Reflection</h2><p class="">Reflection isn’t just about meeting internship requirements, it’s about supporting your ongoing learning. It allows you to develop greater self-awareness, adjust your therapeutic approach, and ensure that you're on the right track with client progress. Don’t hesitate to advocate for your learning needs in supervision and placements. Use your reflections to guide these conversations, whether it’s seeking more feedback or discussing areas where you feel uncertain. </p><p class="">Reflection is a powerful tool that transforms experience into expertise. For early-career psychologists, it is the key to developing professional identity, improving practice, and growing both personally and professionally.</p><p class="">By embracing reflection as a core aspect of your journey, you’ll not only enhance your learning but also strengthen your ability to provide impactful, ethical, and empathetic care to those you serve.</p><p class="">Psychology Squared is here to help with <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychology-students">provisional psychologist resources</a> that have been developed for provisional psychologist to make their internship pathway easier.<strong> </strong>Whether it’s <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe">resources to help you prepare for the NPE</a> or help with <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/supervision-psychology">supervision requirements</a> we are here to help. <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/contact-us">Contact us today</a> to find out more.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994/1733961844141-I4UWGXLNTJ1CK0CIU2XY/Role-of-Reflection-in-Learning-.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="700" height="558"><media:title type="plain">The Role of Reflection in Learning for Early-Career Psychologists</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Time Management for Busy Provisional and Early Career Psychologists</title><dc:creator>MIchael Herzog</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:07:37 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/time-management-for-busy-provisional-and-early-career-psychologists</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:675a1a714a017301833f9c81</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Starting a career in psychology is exciting but it can also feel overwhelming.

  <h2>Acknowledge That Learning Takes Time</h2><p class="">One of the most important things to remember is that you’re still in the learning phase. Tasks that will eventually become second nature often take much longer in the beginning. Whether it’s writing detailed case notes or preparing a treatment plan, allow yourself the space to take longer than you would like. Being new to the field means you’ll need time to hone your skills, and that’s completely normal. Try not to compare yourself to more experienced colleagues, as their efficiency is the result of years of practice.</p><h2>Prioritise Tasks and Set Boundaries</h2><p class="">With so many responsibilities, it’s essential to prioritise. Break down your tasks into what needs to be done immediately, what can wait, and what can be delegated or simplified.&nbsp; For instance, you can be better prepared for the National Psychology Exam if you set a study schedule. If you’re finding it difficult to juggle everything, talk to your supervisor or mentor. Let them know where you’re struggling - they can offer guidance on what truly requires your immediate attention and what can be postponed. This is also where setting boundaries becomes crucial. It’s okay to say no or to request more time if you’re feeling stretched too thin. Advocating for your needs in your placement or work environment isn’t a weakness - it’s a strength.</p><h2>Create Structure with a Flexible Schedule</h2><p class="">It can be tempting to jump from task to task as things come up, but creating some structure around your day can make a huge difference. Start by setting realistic goals for what you want to accomplish each day and week. While you can’t control everything, a flexible schedule allows you to stay on track while leaving room for unexpected situations. Try blocking out specific times for case work, client sessions, study for the NPE practice exam, and self-care. Be kind to yourself if things don’t always go to plan - adapt as necessary but stick to your priorities.</p><h2>Take Breaks to Avoid Burnout</h2><p class="">With the pressure to perform, you might feel like you need to work non-stop to get everything done. But pushing yourself too hard can lead to burnout, which only makes time management more difficult. Schedule regular breaks, even if it’s just a short walk or stepping away from your desk for five minutes. These small breaks give you a chance to reset, clear your mind, and return to your tasks with renewed focus.</p><h2>Advocate for Your Needs</h2><p class="">As a provisional psychologist, you’re in a unique position where you’re both learning and working, and it’s perfectly okay to ask for help when needed. Whether it’s negotiating deadlines, asking for more supervision, or requesting adjustments to your workload, don’t hesitate to advocate for yourself. By managing your time effectively and setting boundaries, you’ll not only improve your productivity but also maintain your wellbeing as you continue to grow into your role.</p><p class="">The early years of a psychology career are filled with challenges, but mastering time management can make them more manageable. By prioritising tasks, setting boundaries, and creating a manageable routine, you’ll set the foundation for a successful and fulfilling career.</p><p class="">Remember, even the best plans can fall apart sometimes. Be kind to yourself, adapt as needed, and celebrate your progress along the way.

  <h2>Be Prepared and Proactive</h2><p class="">Supervision isn't just about passively showing up. To get the most value, it’s important to be proactive, meaning you should come prepared for each session. Take some time beforehand to reflect on your recent experiences – think about what cases have challenged you, which clients left you with unanswered questions, and how you’re feeling about your development. Bringing this awareness into your session will help you focus on areas where you need guidance and support. It’s a good idea to keep a running list of topics or questions between sessions so that nothing gets lost in the shuffle. This proactive approach not only reflects well on you but also reassures supervisors of their investment in mentoring you throughout the internship.</p><h2>Don’t Hesitate to Ask Questions</h2><p class="">Many <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/provpsych">provisional psychologists</a>, especially those new to the field, may feel unsure about what they should ask in supervision. The truth is there’s no wrong questions. Supervisors are there to help guide you, so whether it’s about clinical techniques, ethical concerns, or your own emotional reactions to clients, feel free to ask.&nbsp;They may be able to assist with preparation for the National Psychology Exam.&nbsp; If you're discussing a case and feel uncertain, break it down with your supervisor: What’s happening with the client? What are the treatment goals? What strategies have worked or fallen short? This kind of reflective practice will help you deepen your clinical thinking.</p><h2>Discussing Cases Effectively</h2><p class="">One of the most valuable parts of supervision is getting feedback on your clinical work. When discussing cases, try to present a clear picture to your supervisor. Start with a concise overview of the client’s background, the presenting issue, and any treatment plans or interventions you’ve implemented. Then, focus on areas where you need feedback. Do you feel stuck? Are you unsure about the next step in treatment? Be open to hearing feedback, even if it challenges your initial perspective. This is all part of learning and refining your skills as a psychologist.</p><h2>Build a Collaborative Relationship</h2><p class="">The relationship you develop with your supervisor is a crucial part of the learning process, so think of it as a partnership. A good supervisory relationship is one where you feel comfortable sharing your struggles, doubts, and triumphs. Remember, supervision is a safe space to learn, make mistakes, and grow. If something isn’t working in your supervision, don’t be afraid to discuss it with your supervisor. They can help adjust the focus to better meet your needs.</p><p class="">Establishing a positive relationship with your supervisor can also lead to networking opportunities that may benefit your future career. A supportive supervisor with which you have a positive rapport is more likely to introduce you to key contacts within the field or provide recommendations for future job openings based on their firsthand experience with your work ethic and skills.</p><h2>Final Thoughts: Don’t Be Afraid of Your Supervisor</h2><p class="">It’s natural to feel nervous about supervision, especially when you’re starting out. But it’s important to remember that supervisors are there to help, not to judge. They’ve walked the path before you and understand the learning curve involved. By being open, prepared, and engaged, you’ll find that supervision is not only a requirement but an invaluable <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/ai-npe-tool">tool</a> in <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/">becoming the best psychologist</a> you can be.</p><p class="">Whether you are pre-registration, or on the 4+2 or 5+1 pathway and even if you are recently registered, Psychology Squared offers supervision. <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/contact-us">Get in touch with us online now.</a> </p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994/1730372428941-Q7S7LNDAB80GDPZ0LO46/Psychology-intership.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="700" height="467"><media:title type="plain">Maximising Supervision During Your Internship</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Anxiety, Stress, and the National Psychology Exam</title><dc:creator>MIchael Herzog</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 06:02:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/anxiety-stress-and-the-national-psychology-exam</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:66e13262b4780447428b84c0</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Sitting the National Psychology Exam (NPE) is a significant requirement for many <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/">provisional psychologists on their journey to becoming fully registered</a>.

  <h2>Understanding the Exam Format</h2><p class="">The NPE consists of 150 multiple-choice questions, and you have 210 minutes to complete it. <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npequizes">Exam questions</a> are typically structured with a vignette or scenario, a lead-in question, and a set of five options. Regardless of where you sit the NPE, remotely or at a venue, you will complete it on a computer. Remember, any time used to take the toilet break or drink water comes out of your allocated time; you are not given extra. Considering these constraints, maintaining focus and managing your time effectively is crucial.</p><h2>The Day Before the Exam</h2><p class=""><strong>Familiarise Yourself with the Exam Environment:</strong> If sitting at a venue, plan your route the day before and allow time for unplanned events (e.g cancelled trains, high traffic, difficulty parking). If possible, visit the exam venue beforehand. Knowing the logistics can help reduce anxiety on the day. Aim to arrive 30+ minutes early to give yourself time to settle in.</p><p class=""><strong>Organise Your Materials/Space:</strong> Pack everything you need to get to the venue the night before to avoid last-minute stress or not being able to find something you need, such as your water bottle, exam location details and confirmation email. If sitting at home, ensure your environment is clear, test all technology, and have a clear water bottle. You will need to present the exam supervisor with the following documents:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The printed email confirmation containing your exam authorisation code.</p></li><li><p class="">Two types of formal identification (one must be a photo ID). Examples of photo identification include a passport, driver's licence, or current student photo ID card. Non-photo ID can include a Medicare card, birth certificate, or Australian government concession/health care card.</p></li></ul><p class="">Note: Failure to bring sufficient identification and the exam authorisation code may result in being excluded from sitting the exam.</p><p class=""><strong>Treat Yourself Like a Client:</strong> Think about what you would tell someone else to do when preparing for the NPE. Spend some time practising deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation. Apps like Headspace or Calm offer guided sessions tailored for stress relief. Eat balanced meals and avoid heavy, greasy foods that might make you sluggish. Stay hydrated and try your best to get a good night’s sleep.</p><p class=""><strong>Keep a Positive Mindset:</strong> Remind yourself that you have prepared well. Visualise yourself successfully completing the exam. Positive self-talk can boost your confidence and reduce anxiety.</p><h2>During the Exam</h2><p class=""><strong>1. Manage Your Time:</strong> Allocate specific time slots for each section of the exam, for example aiming to be at question 75 by 1 hour 40 minutes. You have exactly 1.4 minutes per question; perhaps aim for 1.2 minutes and use any extra time to review your answers. Don’t spend too long on any question, just use your best guess, and flag the question to come back to.</p><p class=""><strong>2. Take Mini Breaks:</strong> Though formal breaks are limited, take mini mental breaks. Close your eyes for a few seconds, take deep breaths, and stretch your hands and feet discreetly under the desk to relieve tension.</p><p class=""><strong>3. Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink water before the exam starts and use the toilet before going in. While you may not have frequent access during the exam, staying hydrated beforehand can help maintain your focus. Eat a light meal or snack that provides lasting energy, such as nuts, fruits, or a protein bar.</p><h2>Post-Exam Reflection</h2><p class="">After the exam, take some time to relax and reflect, and acknowledge your efforts. It might feel like you have just run a marathon, so be gentle on yourself and have a low-demand evening. Commonly, people have no idea how well they performed immediately after. Remember, many psychologists before you have successfully passed the NPE, and so can you.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p class="">Facing the <a href="https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Registration/National-psychology-exam/National-psychology-exam-candidate-manual.aspx">National Psychology Exam</a> can be daunting, but with the right strategies, you can manage your anxiety and stress effectively. Good luck, and remember, many psychologists have passed the NPE before you. You got this!</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994/1742266662538-8HUH07ONJEDTNJUJPV8U/Psychology-Exam.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="700" height="467"><media:title type="plain">Anxiety, Stress, and the National Psychology Exam</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Overcoming Imposter Syndrome as a Provisional Psychologist</title><dc:creator>MIchael Herzog</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 04:51:12 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/overcoming-imposter-syndrome-as-a-provisional-psychologist</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:66e120a9a1afae49d3686d15</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Imposter syndrome is a common experience among <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/provpsych" target="_blank">provisional psychologists</a>, particularly those who are completing their studies or internships.

  <h2>Understanding Imposter Syndrome</h2><p class="">Imposter syndrome can be particularly challenging for provisional psychologists, where in many ways you're still learning the ropes. In your clinical work there's a significant power imbalance, as you're often working with vulnerable people who rely on your expertise. This internal conflict can create significant stress and anxiety. Personality traits, such as perfectionism, which likely helped you in your study may make it more likely you experience imposter syndrome.</p><h2>Emotions Have Jobs</h2><p class="">Our emotions are powerful communicators. They provide us with essential information about our internal states and can motivate us for action. When you experience self-doubt, it might be a sign that you need to focus more on certain areas of your professional development. For instance, if you're feeling unsure about your intervention skills, it might be time to seek additional training or supervision in that area.</p><h2>Cognitive Distortions and Thinking Mistakes</h2><p class="">However, not all self-doubt is constructive. Sometimes, our thoughts are clouded by cognitive distortions, which are unrealistic and unhelpful ways of thinking that can reinforce imposter syndrome. Common cognitive distortions include:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>All-or-Nothing Thinking</strong>: Viewing situations in black-and-white terms, without recognising the grey areas.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Over-generalisation</strong>: Seeing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Disqualifying the Positive</strong>: Ignoring or dismissing positive accomplishments and feedback.</p></li></ul><p class="">Recognising these patterns in your thinking can help you challenge and reframe them, leading to a more balanced and accurate self-assessment.</p><h2>Turning Doubt into Development</h2><p class="">When self-doubt strikes, it can be an opportunity to enhance your skills and knowledge. Engage in professional development activities such as attending workshops, <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/supervision-psychology">seeking supervision</a>, and participating in peer discussions. This proactive approach not only improves your competence but can reinforce your confidence. Don’t forget to look for evidence to fact check your thinking. Ask yourself:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">What evidence do I have that supports my feelings of inadequacy?</p></li><li><p class="">What evidence do I have that opposes these feelings?</p></li><li><p class="">Are there examples of my success and positive feedback that I’m ignoring?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="">By systematically evaluating the evidence, you can develop a more objective view of your abilities and achievements. Ask others how you are performing and trust in the feedback from your supervisors and peers. Remember that everyone experiences doubts at times, you've completed rigorous academic and practical training to reach this point.</p><p class="">Imposter syndrome is a common hurdle for provisional psychologists, but it doesn’t have to hold you back. By understanding the role of emotions, identifying cognitive distortions, seeking evidence, and engaging in <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychology-students" target="_blank">ongoing professional development</a>, you can build the confidence needed to thrive in your career. Remember, your journey as a psychologist is a continual learning process, and each step you take brings you closer to becoming the competent professional you aspire to be.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994/1726030481117-VOWUEVMUZ3LY5W3UWM6X/Imposter-Syndrome-.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="700" height="467"><media:title type="plain">Overcoming Imposter Syndrome as a Provisional Psychologist</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>How to Maintain Motivation in the Last 4 Weeks Before Sitting the NPE</title><dc:creator>MIchael Herzog</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 07:52:59 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/how-to-maintain-motivation-in-the-last-4-weeks-before-sitting-the-npe</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:66a77af02c21bf1de487f127</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">As the countdown to the National <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe">Psychology Exam (NPE)</a> begins, maintaining motivation can be a challenge for many provisional <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/">psychologists</a>.

  <h2>1. Plan Your Time</h2><p class="">Creating a detailed study schedule can provide structure and keep you on track. Start by assessing where you are in your confidence with each domain of the exam. Identify your strengths and weaknesses, allocate less time to areas you are already confident in and dedicate more time to domains where you need improvement. Break down your study material into manageable chunks and allocate specific times for each topic. Be realistic about how much time you have and how you will use it. This approach helps prevent feeling overwhelmed and ensures that you cover all necessary content.</p><h2>2. Take Leave if Possible</h2><p class="">If you can, consider taking some time off work or reducing your professional commitments, particularly in the last week or two. This will allow you to dedicate more time to your studies without the added stress of balancing work and exam preparation. Use this period to focus intensively on your exam preparation.</p><h2>3. Prioritise Self-Care</h2><p class="">Taking care of your mental and physical well-being is crucial during this intense period. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to ensure your brain is well-rested. Eat a balanced diet, fuel your body with nutritious foods to maintain energy levels. Exercise regularly, physical activity can boost your mood and improve concentration.</p><h2>4. Reduce Other Commitments</h2><p class="">Minimise social engagements and other non-essential commitments to free up more time for studying. Politely inform friends and family that you'll be less available during this period and request for support with some of your usual activities that are time consuming or draining.</p><h2>5. Practise Self-Compassion</h2><p class="">It's normal to feel anxious or stressed as the exam approaches. Practise self-compassion by acknowledging your efforts and avoiding self-criticism. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and give yourself permission to rest when needed.</p><h2>6. Use Active Study Techniques</h2><p class="">Engage in active study techniques such as:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Practice exams: Simulate the exam environment to get accustomed to the pressure.</p></li><li><p class="">Flashcards: Use them for quick revision and memory reinforcement.</p></li><li><p class="">Group study sessions: Collaborate with peers to discuss challenging topics and gain new perspectives.</p></li></ul><h2>7. Visualise Success</h2><p class="">Spend a few minutes each day visualising yourself successfully completing the exam. Positive visualisation can boost your confidence and reduce anxiety. Imagine walking out of the exam room feeling accomplished and proud of your hard work.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Stay Connected with Your Support System</h2><p class="">Lean on your support system for encouragement and motivation. Whether it’s <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-supervisors">talking to a mentor</a>, a <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe-group-resources-private-page">study group</a>, or family and friends, sharing your feelings and progress can help you stay positive and focused.</p><p class="">The last four weeks before the NPE can be intense, but with the right strategies, you can maintain your motivation and perform your best. Be realistic about your time and allocate tasks wisely. Prioritise self-care, reduce other commitments, practise self-compassion, and use active study techniques. You've worked hard to get to this point, it’s almost over, don’t lose focus now!</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994/1742266720683-U5CPQA4V9OKH5Q5Z57AG/psychologist-talking-and-helping-student%2C.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="700" height="467"><media:title type="plain">How to Maintain Motivation in the Last 4 Weeks Before Sitting the NPE</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Pros and Cons of Sitting the National Psychology Exam (NPE) Online</title><dc:creator>MIchael Herzog</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 06:47:40 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/pros-and-cons-of-sitting-the-national-psychology-exam-npe-online</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:66a76e216c8bf95525e8684d</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">As a <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/provpsych">provisional psychologist</a> in Australia, you have the option to sit the <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe">National Psychology Exam (NPE)</a> either online through an online proctored format or at a designated test centre.

  <h2>Pros of Sitting the NPE Online</h2><p class=""><strong>Flexibility and Convenience:</strong> One of the biggest perks of taking the NPE online is the flexibility it offers. You can take the exam from the comfort of your home or any suitable location, eliminating the need for travel. This can be especially beneficial if you live far from a test centre or have a busy schedule.</p><p class=""><strong>Reduced Stress:</strong> Taking the exam in a familiar environment can help reduce anxiety and stress associated with unfamiliar exam settings. You can set up your exam space to be as comfortable as possible, including adjusting the lighting, temperature, and seating. This level of control can make a significant difference in your comfort and performance during the exam.</p><p class=""><strong>Safety:</strong> Taking the exam online reduces the risk of exposure to illnesses and reduces difficulties with accessibility needs, as not all exam centres will be wheelchair accessible. This is particularly important for those who are vulnerable or have underlying health conditions or disabilities.</p><h2>Cons of Sitting the NPE Online</h2><p class=""><strong>Technical Requirements and Issues:</strong> To sit the exam online, you must have a reliable computer, webcam, microphone, and a stable internet connection. Ensuring that all technical requirements are met can be challenging and unpredictable! There's also the risk of technical glitches, such as internet outages or computer malfunctions, which can disrupt the exam and make it take much longer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if there are significant technological issues, there is the risk that the exam is discontinued.</p><p class=""><strong>Strict Proctoring Rules:</strong> Online exams require a distraction-free environment, which can be difficult if you live with others or do not have a quite clutter free dedicated space. Additionally, you aren’t permitted to read questions aloud or talk during the exam, which might feel restrictive if you're used to verbalising your thoughts.</p><p class=""><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Online exams require multiple forms of identity verification, including photo ID checks and biometric data like keystroke and facial recognition. Any suspicious behaviour or inability to comply with proctor instructions can lead to exam termination and potential disciplinary actions.</p><h2>Final Considerations</h2><p class="">When deciding whether to sit the NPE online, consider your personal comfort with technology, your home environment, and your ability to manage potential technical issues. If you have a stable and quiet home setup and feel comfortable with the technical requirements, the online exam might offer the convenience and flexibility you need. However, if you prefer a structured environment with fewer technical concerns, sitting the exam at a test centre might be a better option.</p><p class="">Regardless of your choice, thorough preparation and familiarising yourself with the exam guidelines will help you approach the NPE with confidence and clarity. If you have any questions or concerns about the exam format, <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/supervision-psychology">reach out to your supervisor</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">Do not forget you must contact the National Psychology Exam Coordinator for any accommodations at least 30 days before your exam date.&nbsp;</p><p class="">See also this discussion on <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/protips4251/2023/9/10/the-biggest-npe-mistake-you-may-accidentally-make">why to sit the exam at the centre.</a></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994/1742266748928-HWZ0Y04LGB9RRRIG1JQH/NPE-Online.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="700" height="467"><media:title type="plain">Pros and Cons of Sitting the National Psychology Exam (NPE) Online</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>NPE Study Techniques and Ideas&nbsp;</title><dc:creator>MIchael Herzog</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 06:46:50 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/npe-study-techniques-and-ideasnbsp</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:66a1f15dc5f1b3639d95ec17</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">If you’re just starting your National Psychology Exam (NPE) preparation, this post has some effective techniques that may help you study.

Do you learn better early in the morning or later in the day?</p>

  <h2>Tips for Retaining Information</h2><p class="">Retaining information can be challenging, but these evidence-based techniques can help:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Active Learning</strong>: Engage actively with the material instead of passively reading information. This might look like asking questions, making notes, and summarising key ideas in your own words. Take what you are learning about to another person or study groups to deepen understanding.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Mind Maps</strong>: Mind maps help you see connections between concepts and make the material more memorable. Create mind maps for each domain or topic to visualise the relationships between different pieces of information. You might like to look at videos on<a href="https://youtu.be/brTMbPyhZY0?si=jRyi5oPm0Ip89QTW"> YouTube about how to create a mindmap</a>.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Teaching Others</strong>: Teaching NPE material to someone else is a powerful way to reinforce your understanding. This might be forming study groups and taking turns teaching each other different topics to maximise your time or telling your patient dog about the ethical considerations for using hypnosis and related practices. Explaining concepts to others helps clarify your own understanding and identify any gaps in knowledge.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Create stories or scenarios that incorporate the information you’re learning or trying to solidify in your mind. This technique makes abstract concepts more concrete and relatable.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong>: Review information at spaced intervals to enhance long-term retention. This may involve regularly revisiting previously studied material to reinforce your memory or using flashcards.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Practice Questions</strong>: Regularly complete practice questions and simulate exam conditions if you can. Practising under exam-like conditions helps you become comfortable with the format and time constraints of answering questions. Regularly completing practice questions helps identify areas where you need further study and improves test-taking skills. We have some great practice questions that allow you to get immediate feedback and under exam-like conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h2>Personal Study Strategies</h2><p class="">When I prepared for the NPE, I found mind maps, storytelling, and teaching others to be particularly effective. Here’s how I used these techniques:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Mind Maps</strong>: I created mind maps for each exam domain and then for individual topics within them, which helped me visualise and connect different concepts. This was especially useful for understanding complex relationships and processes.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Storytelling</strong>: When studying the DSM and specific disorders we needed to have detailed knowledge on I developed stories and scenarios around the information I was learning. This made the material more engaging and easier to remember. I also found drawing Venn diagrams of overlapping disorders and traits helpful to tease ideas that were similar apart.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Teaching Others</strong>: I formed a small study group with a work colleague and joined <a href="https://bit.ly/npejoinaug">Psychology Squared 10 week NPE study program</a>. My work colleague and I took turns teaching each other different topics and explaining concepts to my peers reinforced my understanding and helped identify any gaps in my knowledge.</p></li></ul><p class=""><a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe-group-resources-private-page">Effective preparation for the NPE</a> involves a combination of structured planning, using the right resources, and employing strategies to retain information. We hope the above ideas are helpful in enhancing your study sessions and improve your chances of success. Remember, every psychologist who has passed the NPE started where you are now. With dedication and the right approach, you can pass the exam too.</p><p class="">Have you found any particular study strategies helpful in your preparation for the NPE?

  <h2><strong>Create a Study Schedule</strong></h2><p class="">Research has shown that goal setting and study planning not only improves performance but can even alter your thinking and engagement about your study. A structured study schedule may be helpful for some, where you actively block out study periods and topics in your calendar. Alternatively, a less structured approach may involve a list of goals or topics you will learn about and how you will review the information over the next 4 weeks. However, it will work for you, having an idea of what you want to do, how you will do it and what time you realistically have is crucial for effective NPE preparation.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Here are some ideas to get you started creating a study plan:</p><p class="">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Review Your Timeline</strong>: Determine how many weeks or months you have until you plan to sit the NPE, this will give you a baseline for how long you must prepare. Next block out any planned events where you will be unable to study, such as school holidays, leave, demanding work periods or any other commitment. After this overview, reflect on your usual week and calculate how many hours you can realistically dedicate to study. Be realistic and do not forget to set aside time to relax your brain too!</p><p class="">2. <strong>Incorporate Breaks</strong>: Ensure you have planned regular breaks in your study schedule to avoid overwhelm, losing interest or experiencing burnout. The Pomodoro Technique may be helpful, where you do 25 minutes of focused study followed by a 5-minute break. Some people will find short 30-minute blocks best and others prefer longer 90-120 minute study sessions. If you do a longer study session, make sure you take longer breaks between starting another to rest your brain. Reflect on what has worked for you before and try to make that fit into your schedule.</p><p class="">3. <strong>Divide the Content</strong>: Break down the exam content into manageable sections. Reflect on what you need to know and how much you have used the required knowledge from each domain in your work experience.&nbsp; Then allocate time for each domain: Ethics, Assessment, Interventions, and Communication. Focus more time on areas where you feel less confident and have less experience.</p><p class="">4. <strong>Set Specific Goals</strong>: Set clear, achievable goals for each study session or milestone. For example, "Complete 10 practice questions from Pelling and Burton, choosing a correct answer and explaining why the other answers are incorrect." Track your progress in a structured study plan to monitor what you need to know, and adjust your schedule as needed.</p><p class="">5. <strong>Review Regularly</strong>: Plan for regular review sessions to reinforce what you have learned. Use spaced repetition techniques to enhance long-term retention and review your notes, flashcards, and recommended readings.</p><h3>Recommended Study Materials and Resources</h3><p class="">Using the right study materials can make a significant difference in your preparation. Here are some resources to consider:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Official Guidelines</strong>: Start with the<a href="https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Registration/National-psychology-exam.aspx"> NPE Candidate Manual</a>, the curriculum and reading list provided by the Psychology Board of Australia. These documents outline the exam structure and content in detail. It literally provides you with a list of what you will need to know to sit the NPE. Don’t just review it once at the beginning, continue to refer to this list to make sure you are on progress. It can be less overwhelming to break down the reading list by domain and review one at a time.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Textbooks and Articles</strong>: Select NPE focussed textbooks. Books we have found provide a good overview are The Elements of Applied Psychological Practice in Australia by Pelling and Burton and Ethical Practice in Applied Psychology by Boyle and Gamble.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Study Groups, Online Courses, and Webinars</strong>: Explore online resources, including webinars, study groups or courses that focus on exam preparation and specific psychological topics. At Psychology Squared we offer many<a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe"> NPE related products</a>, such a <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists/p/national-psychology-exam-npe-peer-group-on-zoom-">peer facilitated discussion group</a>, recorded webinars, <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists/p/national-psychology-exam-quiz-bundle" target="_blank">Kahoot quizzes</a>, and have a Facebook group dedicated to the NPE. Even just having someone to study with is likely to be helpful.</p></li></ul><p class="">Have you found a different approach helpful for you to start your <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/ai-npe-tool">NPE planning</a> or gained a new insight from this post?

  <h2><strong>Finding More Time - Option 1:</strong></h2><p class="">If you have completed your client direct and client related hours, you might consider taking leave from work (e.g., annual leave or unpaid leave) if your circumstances allow. This could enable you to finalise the last tasks, arrange supervision, and tie up all loose ends without being delayed by client work. We recognise that some people may not have leave available or that employers may be reluctant to grant time off. However, taking time off is your best chance to complete your internship rapidly</p><h2><strong>Finding More Time - Option 2:</strong></h2><p class="">If taking leave is too difficult, consider reducing your work week to 3 or 4 days or cutting back your work hours. You may need to think about how to cover reduced wages, but this strategy gives you at least a few more hours each week. The key is to avoid inadvertently doing your paid work or other commitments on your day off, which could distract you from finishing.</p><h2><strong>Taking Ownership of Your Time</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Taking Ownership of Your Time:</strong></p></li></ul><p class="">You can also work on taking more control of your time.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Calendar Blocking</strong>: Allocate specific time slots for task-related activities, as opposed to work or self-care. Use calendar tools (e.g. Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar) to create visual schedules that help you maintain focus and balance.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>The Power of 'No</strong>': Learn to say no to additional commitments that are not directly related to your internship tasks. This safeguards your time.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Communication</strong>: Establish clear lines of communication with your supervisor and manager about your need to focus on your internship.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Do a little every day</strong></h2><p class="">Aim to make regular progress with your tasks every day. Even if it's short bursts, this will help you stay on track</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Case report writing: Persevere with progressing through the reports a little each day.&nbsp;Revisions and refinement will undoubtedly be needed, but this proactive approach makes the overall workload more manageable</p></li><li><p class="">Set a schedule for the rest of your internship. This will help you plan your days around the tasks that need to be completed, making it easier to chip away at them each day.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>In Conclusion: Your Gateway to Growth</strong></h2><p class="">By taking a proactive, balanced, and strategic approach, you can complete your internship soon!&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Provisional Psychologists</strong>:&nbsp;Congratulations on your dedication and your accomplishment to get this far.

  <h2><strong>Reasons for Extended Internships:</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Heavy Workload</strong>: Balancing client work, paperwork, and supervision sessions, along with meeting the expectations of employers and supervisors, can be overwhelming. Managing client satisfaction and employer demands, in addition to completing logbooks and tasks, is a daunting task.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Challenging AHPRA Tasks:</strong> Preparing for the <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe" target="_blank"><strong>National Psychology Exam</strong></a> or completing Case Reports can be time-consuming and stressful, contributing to delays in internship completion.&nbsp;The case reports are 2500 words (+- 10%) so they can be burdensome to work through.&nbsp; It is important to realise that failing these could delay your internship.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> The pressure to complete internship tasks can significantly reduce time for social activities, exercise, and relaxation.&nbsp;Social arrangements, social media, hobbies and interests are all necessary and important to your well-being, and should be managed in your scheduling ideally.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Personal Life Interferences:</strong> Unforeseen personal events or issues can hinder task completion efficiency.</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Note:</strong> It's important not to view an extended internship duration as a failure. Each individual's circumstances are unique, and progress towards becoming a <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/logbook" target="_blank"><strong>registered psychologist</strong></a> is still being made.</p><p class=""><strong>Consequences of an Extended Internship: Delayed Registration</strong>: Prolonging your internship can postpone your completion date, affecting your ability to become registered and impacting your career progression.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Additional Requirements</strong>: A longer internship may result in extra logbooks, observations, progress reports, and supervision sessions, leading to a sense of professional stagnation and disrupting life plans.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Fatigue</strong>: The internship becomes <strong>very tiring </strong>and the more it is prolonged the more effort it takes to get it all done and the more burnt out you may feel.</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Moving Forward:</strong></p><p class="">It's essential to focus on completing your internship efficiently.

One of these is for the provisional psychologist to leverage all their available resources for the Psychological Exam. The provisional psychologist should seek out recommended readings and resources that can provide additional perspectives, and consider resources that offer real-world scenarios for a more practical understanding of the National Psychology Examination subject matter. This strategy can be particularly useful for subjects like ethics where theoretical guidelines can often be abstract.</p><p class="">Effective National Psychology exam preparation is also key for the <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists" target="_blank"><strong>provisional psychologist</strong></a> at this stage of their psychology internship. Use active recall methods to improve retention. This involves actively testing your knowledge of national psychologist examination material and trying to recall information without looking at the source, you would likely better remember the material during the exam.</p>

  <h2>Here are some less known study strategies that may also help you prepare for the National Psychology Exam:</h2><p class=""><strong>Self-Explanation:</strong> Explaining new concepts to yourself, the provisional psychologist can enhance understanding and facilitate better memory recall. This technique can also be used for the provisional psychologist to explain theoretical concepts in your own words, helping you better understand and retain the information.</p><p class=""><strong>Repetition After Intervals:</strong> Revisit and revise the information after certain intervals to enhance retention of National Psychology Examination material. This may help you consolidate memories.</p><p class=""><strong>Create Mind Maps:</strong> Visualizing concepts within the national <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>psychology internship</strong></a> in the form of diagrams can help to understand complex information. Mind maps used by the provisional psychologist can also aid in connecting related concepts, engaging your eyes and brain with the study information in another way.</p><p class=""><strong>Teach Other provisional psychologists in the psychology internship:</strong> One of the best ways to understand a concept thoroughly is to teach another provisional psychologist. If you are familiar with course content you would be better able to put information more simply and explain key points to others.</p><p class=""><strong>Mnemonic Devices:</strong> Use devices like acronyms, imagery, or rhymes to remember important information. This strategy can be particularly helpful for lists, definitions and other information-heavy content. This can be used to remember information which has a natural order or not.</p><p class=""><strong>Incorporate Movement:</strong> Incorporating exercise or movement into your study breaks can help increase focus and energy. Try some simple stretches or a quick walk to relax your mind and body before returning to studying.&nbsp; Additionally, this can have a positive impact on your overall health and well-being in addition to your performance in the National Psychology Exam.</p><p class=""><strong>Use of Technology:</strong> Leverage digital tools like educational apps and websites that offer interactive learning experiences. For example, using Quizlet for creating flashcards or watching educational videos. You may also benefit from listening to audiobooks.</p><p class=""><strong>Study the National Psychology Examination material in Different Locations:</strong> Changing your study environment can stimulate your brain, making it more receptive and engaged in learning. Consider studying in a variety of settings, such as a library, coffee shop, or even outdoors. This can help the provisional psychologist avoid monotony and improve overall productivity.</p><p class=""><strong>Use of Music or White Noise:</strong> Some studies suggest that background music or white noise can enhance focus and concentration, particularly for tasks that require intense cognition. Experiment with different types of music or sounds to find what works best for you.</p><p class=""><strong>Sleep on It:</strong> Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. Irregular and insufficient sleep can impact memory and cognitive function. Make sure to maintain a regular sleep schedule to let your brain process and consolidate the information you've learned throughout the day.</p><p class="">Psychology Squared are here to help provisional psychologists prepare for the National Psychology Examination with peer study groups designed to provide an interactive and comprehensive study experience.

  <h2>Understanding Your Learning Style for the National Psychology Examination:</h2><p class="">The key for the <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists" target="_blank"><strong>provisional psychologist</strong></a> to effective studying often lies in understanding your learning style. We all process information differently, and what works for one provisional psychologist may not work for another. For instance, visual learners may benefit from the use of diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual aids to understand complex concepts.&nbsp;</p><p class="">On the other hand, auditory learners might find it more useful to listen to recorded lectures or engage in group discussions to reinforce their understanding. Be aware of your preferred learning method, and tailor your study techniques accordingly. This will maximise your success in this stressful part of the psychology internship.</p><p class="">You may prefer to study later in the day or early in the morning, depending on your personal schedule and productivity levels. Experiment with different methods and schedules to find what works best for you.</p><h2>The Power of Study Groups for the National Psychology Examination:</h2><p class="">Being part of a provisional psychologist study group can be incredibly beneficial. It provides an opportunity to engage in active discussion, clarify doubts, and gain diverse perspectives on a single topic with other provisional psychologists. If your group is focusing on a certain subject one week, such as ethics, try to align your personal study plan with that subject. This way, you're not only preparing for your group discussions but also reinforcing the information through your individual study time. The Psychology Squared National Psychology Examination peer groups (See<a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe" target="_blank"> <span>https://psychologysquared.com.au/npe</span></a> ) are hugely helpful for this purpose.&nbsp;You don't need to be alone in your study program.</p><h2>Creating a National Psychology Examination Study Plan:</h2><p class="">Creating a National Psych Exam customised study plan is an effective method for managing your academic workload. A study plan not only keeps your studies organised but also acts as a motivational tool, helping you stay committed to your learning goals. Align your study plan with your study group's schedule, if you have one. This method ensures a consistent focus, allowing for a deeper understanding for the provisional psychologist of each topic. Remember, learning is not a race, but a journey as a provisional psychologist. Take the time to process and understand information thoroughly to achieve maximum benefit from your studies.</p><p class="">When developing this plan for this part of your psychology internship be realistic, and self compassionate.&nbsp;If you're studying around full time work, it will be challenging to find the energy and motivation to study.&nbsp;If you're too ambitious and falter, try to course correct recognise your efforts no matter how small.</p><p class="">Note that since the National Psychology Examination is a multiple choice exam the way you study could be rather different you'll be studying to recognise correct responses rather than writing sentences, paragraphs or essays.</p><p class="">Your psychology internship studies should include practising answering questions based on the National Psychology Examination in a more relaxed but also within a timed environment.

As a provisional psychologist embarking on the journey to prepare for the National Psychology Examination can be daunting, especially when you're juggling the psych internship and other obligations. The hours in a day feel insufficient as you try to balance your psychology internship, logbooks, and various other requirements with the colossal task of studying for the National Psychology Examination. This constant juggling of tasks can make it challenging to even get started with the study process and as the pressure builds up can result in a state of paralysis.</p>

  <p class="">Moreover, the sheer volume of the NPE curriculum can often lead the provisional psychologist to feel overwhelmed. The reading list for the exam is extensive, covering a multitude of topics that one needs to master. It's not uncommon to feel swamped as you delve into the depths of the syllabus, trying to absorb vast amounts of information and knowledge. This overwhelming feeling&nbsp;is a significant hurdle many aspiring <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists" target="_blank"><strong>provisional psychologists</strong></a> face when preparing for the National Psychology Examination.</p><p class="">Lastly, burnout is a substantial challenge in the journey of the provisional psychologist. The combination of a demanding internship, a vast curriculum, and other responsibilities can lead to exhaustion, both mentally and physically. This constant state of stress and fatigue can affect not just your preparation for the exam, but also your overall well-being. Balancing time between studying and managing other responsibilities can push you to the brink of burnout, making it another significant challenge in your journey to pass the National Psychology Exam.</p><h2>The solutions</h2><p class="">Despite the many challenges that come with preparing for the National Psychology Examination, there are effective strategies to help manage these obstacles. Firstly, prioritising your study schedule is crucial. With a vast curriculum to cover, it might seem intimidating. But remember, every complex task becomes manageable when broken down into smaller parts. Focus on dividing the reading list into manageable sections and concentrate on the most significant or challenging topics first.</p><p class="">Moreover, consider making good use of your commute time and breaks. Find audiobooks or other accessible study materials that you can review while on the move. Similarly, instead of reaching for your phone during breaks, use that time for a quick revision or to cover a topic from your study list. This way, you not only make efficient use of your time but also prevent procrastination.</p><p class="">However, in the midst of all this, do not neglect your physical and mental well-being. It is essential for your survival in the psych internship to ensure adequate sleep, eat healthily, and take short breaks when necessary. Prioritising your well-being will keep you energised, help you avoid burnout, and maintain your focus on the study material.&nbsp;It is a psychological exam in more ways than 1!</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>The role of effective time management and planning in preparation for the National Psychology Examination</strong> - Exploring different planning strategies and their effectiveness in managing the vast curriculum.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>The impact of support groups and study circles on exam preparation</strong> - The benefits of collective learning and peer support during the preparation process.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Utilizing technology for exam preparation</strong> - The use of online resources, study apps, and digital flashcards to enhance learning and retention.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>The influence of mindfulness and meditation in reducing stress during exam preparation</strong> - Exploring how mindfulness techniques can help maintain mental well-being and focus.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Exploring the role of professional coaching in navigating through the preparation for the National Psychology Examination</strong> - How expert guidance can provide structure and strategic direction in the journey.</p></li></ul><p class="">Lastly, remember, you are not alone in this psych internship journey.

We figure that as a provisional psychologist, you may wish to also deep dive into psychology issues even if they’re not in the National Psychological Exam!</p><p class="">In the psychological internships, we often focus our study on the Psychological treatment modalities which may be limiting.  However, we think understanding social interactions is important as social issues are often a source of distress for adults and children alike. When you're completing the psychological pathways, consider broadening your learning as a way to best support your clients.</p><p class="">Not all friendships are equal, yet people can easily become distressed if they think their friends are not putting into the relationship as much as they receive. For instance, you may call your friend more than they call you, or you may always be the one to initiate plans. This can lead to feelings of resentment and disappointment, causing people to question whether their friendship is really equal.</p>

  <p class="">Some people believe in the myth of friendship equivalency—that all friendships should be give-and-take in perfect balance. Many individuals foster the notion that friendships should exhibit a 1:1 ratio of give and take; if one friend extends an invitation or favor, they anticipate an equal response. They measure their friendships based on the frequency of being called, invitations received, or the number of times a friend has initiated conversations.</p><p class="">This belief system stems from the idea of equity in relationships, assuming that both parties should invest an equal amount of time, effort, and emotional energy. Consequently, they might perceive any deviation from this supposed balance as a sign of inequality or a lack of mutual affection.</p><p class="">However, this is not a realistic expectation for any relationship, including friendships.&nbsp; Rather than focusing on the quantity or quality of friendships, it's more important to recognise that each relationship we have serves a different purpose and fills a unique role in our lives. Some friends may be there for emotional support during tough times, while others may provide practical advice or simply bring joy and laughter into our lives. Some friends may be good for a chat, while others are better at joining in for a sporting activity or attending concerts together.</p><p class="">The key is to appreciate each friendship for what it brings to our lives instead of trying to make it fit into a specific mold or measure its worth against other friendships. By acknowledging the differences and individuality of each relationship, we can avoid the trap of comparing and weighing our friendships against each other.</p><p class="">Moreover, just because a friend may not always be able to reciprocate in the same way or with the same intensity, it doesn't mean that they don't value your friendship. Everyone has different capacities and ways of expressing themselves, and it's important to respect and understand that. It's also important to understand that the dynamics of friendships can change over time. As we grow and evolve as individuals, so do our relationships with others.</p><p class="">Instead of focusing on whether your friendship seems equal, consider this: a) Do you have a good time together? b) Do they seem to be enjoying themselves when they're with you? c) Do you feel supported and valued in their presence? If the answer is yes to these questions, then the friendship could be a valuable one, regardless of any perceived imbalances.</p><p class="">In short, let go of the myth of friendship equivalency and appreciate each relationship for its unique qualities and what it brings to your life. True friendships are not about keeping score or trying to achieve an imaginary state of balance, but rather about cherishing the connections and experiences shared with others. In fact, differences can be identified but then celebrated, making friendships all the more enriching and meaningful. Let's embrace the idea that not all friendships are equal, but they can still be valuable in their own special way.</p><p class=""><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Troubleshooting internship problems: #3 “I’m having trouble getting sufficient observations recorded." </title><dc:creator>David Lopis</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 06:40:27 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/2023/10/5/troubleshooting-internship-problems-3-im-having-trouble-getting-sufficient-observations-recorded</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:651e5a2ed1ef8e020670ba14</guid><description><![CDATA[Do you experience obstacles when trying to record observations for your

  <p class="">For instance, if your employer poses restrictions on recordings, try engaging them in a conversation about the importance of these observations for your internship process.  Reassure them about the privacy measures, such as the recordings being deleted post-review.&nbsp;</p><p class="">When it comes to clients, clear communication about the purpose, confidentiality, and respect for their privacy can often alleviate their concerns.  Remember, you also have the option of seeking permission for audio-only observations, if obtaining consent for visual recordings becomes difficult.  Maybe prepare a statement in advance, and practise saying it before seeing the client, and have preprinted a permission sheet, that you are well versed at presenting.  This will assist you to get better success for obtaining permission when talking.&nbsp; You will be able to help your client&nbsp; understand that this is standard practice for your internship.&nbsp;</p><p class="">An assessment observation is generally more difficult to obtain permission, as it is usually at the beginning of your relationship with the client, and you are still building rapport.  However, assessment observation can occur at any time.  For example, after a few sessions you may need to do a reassessment or even a new assessment as it may become apparent the client has a different presentation than you were treating (e.g, depressive symptoms are now being reported).  You can then do an observation of an assessment for their depression a few sessions into the therapy.</p><p class="">Finally, for those working in environments like homes, schools, or prisons and are encountering difficulties getting observations, creativity is key.  Brainstorm with your supervisors or peers on how you can navigate industry-specific challenges.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Troubleshooting internship problems: #2 “I can’t get started on my Case Reports.”</title><dc:creator>David Lopis</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 05:38:11 +0000</pubDate><link>https://david-lopis.squarespace.com/protips4251/casereports</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56b2cf27f8baf36d1ae2b994:63cefe445395361bb23a78b5:651118387cb8550317f1f0e1</guid><description><![CDATA[Case reports can be difficult to get started and to make the time needed to

  <p class=""><br></p><p class="">It is important to take time and ensure that the information is fully understood before starting. Blockages can occur when someone feels overwhelmed or doesn’t know where to begin. It is important to understand the main blockages and some ways to overcome them:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Time Management - It is important to set aside a certain amount of time each day or week that will be dedicated to case reports, and keep to it. If you find yourself falling behind, try speaking with your supervisor or manager about ways to find extra hours in order to get the work completed on time. When working on your case reports, consider spending 10-15 minutes before work when you are fresh before your work day starts.</p></li><li><p class="">Clients don’t seem suitable.  A common hurdle that many interns encounter is the selection of suitable clients for their case reports. But what defines a "suitable" client? Ideally, the client should not be overly complex, should not pose any immediate risks to themselves or others. It is important to consider focussing on just 1 issue (e.g. GAD) rather than including multiple diagnoses.&nbsp; The reason for this is that it is difficult to do justice to 2 mental health issues in the word limit provided.</p></li><li><p class="">Lack of knowledge - The AHPRA guidelines on the case reports are lacking detail and specifics (<a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists/the-case-report-pack-with-a-brief-webinar-on-the-top-10-things-to-know-when-writing-a-case-report" target="_blank">Psychology Squared Case Report document</a>). We have heaps of tips to help you with this. Visit our <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists" target="_blank">Provisional Psychologist page</a> and browse the available items.</p></li><li><p class="">Lacking motivation in the internship to get through the case report. It can be difficult to find the motivation if you’re feeling tired or burnt out. It is possible that you may need to spend time focussing on self care even if this delays your internship.</p></li><li><p class="">Procrastination - this may be related to feelings that the task is too hard or to perfectionism, in that you feel you may produce anything that’s good enough.</p></li></ol><p class="">Therefore, it is important to talk to your supervisor and peers about your challenges and get the support you need.

  <p class="">Here are a few strategies that you can utilise to get back on track and complete the requirements of your internship:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Take leave (e.g. annual leave or unpaid leave). Taking a break from work will give you more time to focus and concentrate on completing your tasks without feeling rushed or stressed.</p></li><li><p class="">Reduce your working week. If you can afford to, working fewer days in your internship role will give you the extra time you need to focus on your tasks.</p></li><li><p class="">Make a plan. Prioritise the most important and urgent tasks, so that you can work through them <span>efficiently and systematically.</span></p></li><li><p class="">Utilise resources such as <a href="https://psychologysquared.com.au/products-for-provisional-psychologists">Psychology Squared’s articles or guides</a> which provide practical advice on managing internship commitments whilst staying sane in the process! Depending on the organisation, some internship tasks may be allowed to be completed after resigning from your work role. Check with your internship provider for further information.</p></li></ul><p class=""><em>Bonus Tip: Don’t forget to reward yourself for your successes. Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small!</em></p><p class="">You can do this!&nbsp; Keep going and don’t give up when times get tough. When you need a quick break or some extra motivation, refer back to this blog post and remind yourself that you’ve got this!&nbsp; </p><p class=""><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
